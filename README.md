### _A Deep Learning Model for Predicting Breast Cancer Molecular Subtypes on Overall b-Value Diffusion-weighted MRI_

### by _XinXiang Zhou, Lan Zhang, Xiang-Quan Cui, Hui Li, Zhi-Chang Ba, Hong-Xia Zhang, Yue-Min Zhu, Zi-Xiang Kuai_

#### Usage of these codes:

1.using 'parameters_generate.py' to generate blank dictionary.

2.using 'train_model.py' and 'train_fusion_model.py'to train model with different methods. The weights of trained model will stored in dictionary.

3.Model architecture can be seen in 'model_module.py'.

4.Detials of training fuctions can be seen in 'training_fuction.py'.

5.Generation of dataset for training can be seen in 'dataset.py'.

6.'model_test.py'. is to caculate the value of Accuracy and AUC.

7.The preprocessed datasets and the weights of trainned models are avaliable (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/starzh10/breastcaner-subtypes).
