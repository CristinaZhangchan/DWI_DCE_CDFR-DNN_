### by _XinXiang Zhou, Lan Zhang, Xiang-Quan Cui, Hui Li, Zhi-Chang Ba, Hong-Xia Zhang, Yue-Min Zhu, Zi-Xiang Kuai_

#### Usage of these codes:

1.Using 'parameters_generate.py' to generate blank dictionary.

2.Using 'train_model.py' and 'train_fusion_model.py'to train models. The weights of trained models can be stored in the dictionary.

3.Model architecture can be seen in 'model_module.py'.

4.Detials of training can be seen in 'training_fuction.py'.

5.Detials of dataset can be seen in 'dataset.py'.

6.Using 'model_test.py' to caculate the accuracies and AUCs.

7.The processed datasets are openly avaliable at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/starzh10/breastcaner-subtypes.
